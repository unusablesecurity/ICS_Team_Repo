# ICS_Security_Infrastructure_Informational
Informational for ICS security setup and deployment for use by Group14 headquarters staff. 
This repository is a collection of web articles, adversarial vectors, known vulnerabilities, 
security implementation guides, and released materials from the US government, Mitre, and various other sources
that are pertinent to the process system controls and security implementation at Group14 headquarters.
The repository is broken into modules that contain specific information regarding the field represented within
the directory name and powerpoints are contained within those modules to be used as informational supplements for 
dissemination of information to those faculty who are not directly involved in the security sector of Group14; 
basically these powerpoints are to be used as a source of palleatable information for those of us who aren't completely
lost in the black box of cybersecurity and may not understand all the terminology or computer science concepts within the 
articles or resources contained within the repository; these presentations contain both a distillation of pertinent, digestable 
information and graphical representation of concepts that may require an aide.
